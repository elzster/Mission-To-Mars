## Mission to Mars!
----------------------------------------------
#### Description:

In this project we utilized various frameworks to achieve a customized homepage front that populates with most recent data that's pulled from various sources.

* #### FrameWorks Utilized:
     * Python
     * Flask
     * Mongo DB
     * Beauitful Soup
     * Selenium
     * HTML

First, we went developed our Web Scraper scripts through the utilization of Beautiful Soup to target and store specfic data into lists/dictionaries.

After this step, we then transposed the specific data into a python file, which would run when initiated by user input from the homepage.  This was named "scrape_mars.py".

We then developed our flask server and utilized the render templates framework to have a an interactive webpage front that the user can initate our webscraper script.  Each time the user would initiate the "scrape new data" it would sift through all of the provide Mars websites pulling the most recent data and rendering it to our index.html file.
